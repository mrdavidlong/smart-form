# Smart Form

Smart Forms are dynamic forms in which the next questions are based on the previous answers responded by the users of the forms

## Features
This project makes it easy for developers to build dynamic forms with these features: 

* Get the next question based on the current question and the response from the user
* Get the question text can be dynamically changed according to the user response
* Count the number of steps to the end, so that we can generate a progress bar
