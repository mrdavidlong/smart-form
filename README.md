# Smart Form

Smart Forms are dynamic forms in which the next questions are based on the previous answers responded by the users of the forms

## Features
This project makes it easy for developers to build dynamic forms with these features: 

* Get the next question based on the current question and the user response
* Get the question text can be dynamically changed based on the user response
* Count the number of steps to the end question. This number can be used to build a progress bar.

## Live Examples

* Demo page: http://porchdotcom.github.io/smart-form/
* Porch uses Smart Forms to build dynamic forms such as the home project form: https://porch.com/home/project/electricians

If your smart form definition data is in a JSON file, you can run a JSON validation against it using the included schema file, src/schema/smart-form-schema.json, by simply running this command:

    npm run validate-form <mySmartFormJson.json>

If you don't want to install npm, you can run any json validator using src/schema/smart-form-schema.json
