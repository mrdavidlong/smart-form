# Smart Form

Smart Forms are dynamic forms in which the next questions are based on the previous answers responded by the users of the forms

## Features
This project makes it easy for developers to build dynamic forms with these features: 

* Get the next question based on the current question and the response from the user
* Get the question text can be dynamically changed according to the user response
* Count the number of steps to the end, so that we can generate a progress bar

## Usage

### Without Node.js (HTML)

You can just include the JavaScript file and use it in the HTML.  An example is in /examples/html/example.html

    <script src="https://github.com/porchdotcom/smart-form/tree/master/releases/0.1.0/smart-form-utils.js"></script>
    <script>
        SmartFormUtils.getNextQuestionName()
        SmartFormUtils.getQuestionText()
        SmartFormUtils.countMaxStepsToEnd()
    </script>

### With Node.js
    
    var SmartFormUtils  = require('smart-form').utils;
    SmartFormUtils.getNextQuestionName()
    SmartFormUtils.getQuestionText()
    SmartFormUtils.countMaxStepsToEnd()
